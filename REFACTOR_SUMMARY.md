# Backlinks State Key Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Refactored the key used to store the state of backlinks panels in the `mondoState` frontmatter object.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definition Update (`src/types/MondoEntityConfig.ts`)

- Added `key?: string` property to `MondoEntityBacklinksLinkConfig` interface
- Added `collapsed?: boolean` property to `MondoEntityBacklinksLinkConfig` interface

### 2. Component Update (`src/containers/EntityLinks/panels/BacklinksLinks.tsx`)

- Updated `BacklinksPanelConfig` type to use the imported `MondoEntityBacklinksLinkConfig` interface
- Updated `panelKey` computation to use the explicit `key` property from the config when available
- **New pattern**: `backlinks:{key}`
- **Fallback pattern** (for backward compatibility): `backlinks:{targetType}:{property}`

### 3. Entity Configuration Updates

#### Default Backlinks (`src/entities/default-backlinks.ts`)

All backlinks in the DEFAULT_BACKLINKS array now have unique keys:

- `facts` - Facts that reference the entity
- `logs` - Logs that reference the entity
- `documents` - Documents that reference the entity
- `tasks` - Tasks that reference the entity

#### Person Entity (`src/entities/person.ts`)

Backlinks with assigned keys:

- `teammates` - People who share at least one team
- `1on1-meetings` - 1:1 meetings with the person
- `meetings` - Meetings (deep linked via teams)
- `projects` - Projects (deep linked via teams)
- `reports` - People who report to this person

#### Company Entity (`src/entities/company.ts`)

Backlinks with assigned keys:

- `employees` - Employees working at the company
- `teams` - Teams within the company
- `projects` - Projects associated with the company

## Frontend State Storage Pattern

The new pattern for storing backlinks panel state in frontmatter `mondoState`:

```yaml
mondoState:
  backlinks:teammates:
    collapsed: false
  backlinks:1on1-meetings:
    collapsed: true
  backlinks:meetings:
    collapsed: false
  backlinks:projects:
    collapsed: false
  backlinks:reports:
    collapsed: true
  backlinks:facts:
    collapsed: false
  backlinks:logs:
    collapsed: false
  backlinks:documents:
    collapsed: true
  backlinks:tasks:
    collapsed: false
```

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:

- If a backlinks item doesn't have an explicit `key`, the system falls back to computing one from `targetType` and `properties`
- Existing notes with the old state key pattern will continue to work
- New notes will use the cleaner, more explicit `backlinks:{key}` pattern

## Benefits

1. **Explicit and Clear**: Each backlinks panel has a unique, semantic key that describes its purpose
2. **Maintainable**: Easier to track which panels correspond to which keys in frontmatter
3. **Flexible**: Allows for easy addition of new backlinks panels without naming conflicts
4. **Consistent**: Follows the pattern already established for drag-and-drop ordering: `{panel}.order`
