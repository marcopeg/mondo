# How to Install & Update

ObsidianCRM is under active development so you would install it as a _Beta Tester_ at your own risk. But it's fine, I use it for myself first and it works, even if it needs a lot of love still!

1. First, install the [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) that lets you install orther plugins directly from GitHub.

2. Open the _BRAT_ plugin preferences and click on "Add beta plugin"

3. Paste the following url:

```bash
https://github.com/marcopeg/obsidian-crm
```

> I suggest you keep it updated to the latest version, but at this point feel free to install whatever available release.

# 📆 Daily Notes

Daily notes help jotting down quick information.

`Shift+Cmd+l` opens the **Daily Note** and generates a time-based section where you can quickly annotate a new thought.

Notes in your daily are automatically organized by day/time blocks and default to bullet lists so to facilitate note refactoring later on.

# 📝 Journal

Dealing with the modern world and its crazy pace can crash your soul. **Journaling** is a simple yet effective way to keep your thoughts, emotions, and hidden convinctions under control.

Hit `Shift+Cmd+j` and write anything that is personal.

> Let yourself go.  
> Don't think.  
> Just write.
