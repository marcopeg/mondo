# 📆 Daily Notes

Daily notes help jotting down quick information.

`Shift+Cmd+l` opens the **Daily Note** and generates a time-based section where you can quickly annotate a new thought.

Notes in your daily are automatically organized by day/time blocks and default to bullet lists so to facilitate note refactoring later on.

# 📝 Journal

Dealing with the modern world and its crazy pace can crash your soul. **Journaling** is a simple yet effective way to keep your thoughts, emotions, and hidden convinctions under control.

Hit `Shift+Cmd+j` and write anything that is personal.

> Let yourself go.  
> Don't think.  
> Just write.
