# How to Install & Update

ObsidianMondo is under active development so you would install it as a _Beta Tester_ at your own risk. But it's fine, I use it for myself first and it works, even if it needs a lot of love still!

1. First, install the [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) that lets you install orther plugins directly from GitHub.

2. Open the _BRAT_ plugin preferences and click on "Add beta plugin"

3. Paste the following url:

```bash
https://github.com/marcopeg/mondo
```

> I suggest you keep it updated to the latest version, but at this point feel free to install whatever available release.

# 🏚️ Dashboard

Run the command `Open Mondo Dashboard` to open your vault's control center:

- **Quick Tasks** let you create new task-notes on the fly by typing or dictating your thoughs.
- **Relevant Notes** let you find your notes by frequency of utilization or history. And you can filter by _Entity Type (see the CRM feature)_-
- **CRM Entities Wall** wall let you jump to the various entities lists. Think \_"Obsidian bases on steroid".
- **Stats** show some numbers about your valut and offer some file based views of your stuff. Not only notes, but also images, audio and generic attachments across the whole vault.

# 🎤 Dictation

> This feature requires an [OpenAI API Key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)

Dictation lets you write your note's content with your voice, by sending a recording to OpenAI Whisper for transcription.

Use the command `Start dictation`, or press the microphone button to initiate a dictation session. The resulting transcription is inserted at your cursor's position.

# 📝 Transcription

> This feature requires an [OpenAI API Key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)

Use the command `Start transcription` when over an _audio note_ to start the transcription process.

Once done, a new note with the full transcription and a reference to the original audio will be created and opened for you.

# 🔈 Voiceover

> This feature requires an [OpenAI API Key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)

Use the command `Start voiceover` on a text note to produce the relative audio file and reproduce it.

The file will be automatically referenced into the note's _frontmatter_.

> You can use the _Voiceover_ also on a text-selection!

# 🕰️ Timestamps

Run the command `Insert timestamp` to inject a pre-configured date-time text in your note, where your cursor is.

You can configure the template in the Mondo's settings.

Here is an example of a Heading level 2 timestamp template:

```Markdown
## YY/MM/DD hh:mm
```

# 🧘 Focus Mode

Sometimes, you just want to get lost in your writing.

Run the command `Start Focus Mode` to hide away most of the Obsidian UI and focus entirely on your writing activity.

👉 Mondo will activate this mode any time you step into your Journal to give you maximum focus on introspection and self-awarness.

# 🤖 Open in ChatGPT

Take any note or text selection and use the command `Send to ChatGPT` to open the famous AI tool with a pre-compiled prompt.

# 🌆 Image Editor

Open an image and run the command `Edit Image` to open the image editor. 

There you can **resize** and **crop** an image to improve your vault without leaving it.

> 📲 works on mobile as well!

# 👫 Mondo IMS

Mondo ships a powerful _Information Management System_ in which you can define your own entities and their relations to bring to life your tailored ERP/CRM/CMS of sort.

👉 Use the **IMS Presets** to experiment with common and community-curated systems!

# 📈 Habits Tracker

Tracking my daily habits is an important part of my self development plan, and i wantet it to be fully included into my Obsidian workflow.

I heep a "Habits.md" note where I put all my tracking blocks.

The default visualization is the **last 21-days streak**:

![source](./images/habit-tracker-streak.png)

but you can switch to the **calendar view** to have a bird-eye view of your entire calendar year:

![source](./images/habit-tracker-calendar.png)

You can add a block as many `habits` blocks you want:

![source](./images/habit-tracker-source.png)

👉 Be careful configuring a unique `key` for each block because the data is stored in the note's _frontmatter_ under that key.

# ⏱️ Training Timers

# 📆 Daily Notes (to refine)

Daily notes help jotting down quick information.

Run the command `Open Daily note` to open the **Daily Note**; or run `Append to Daily note` to open it an generate a time-based section where you can quickly annotate a new thought.

Notes in your daily are automatically organized by day/time blocks and default to bullet lists so to facilitate note refactoring later on.

Configure the template and shape of the time-based annotations in the `Mondo Settings`.

Mondo keeps a log of all the notes that were created, modified, and opened each day in the _Daily Note_. That becomes your vault's hystory datatabase and also a damn good way to find out notes when you rememeber when you worked on someting.

# 📝 Journal (to refine)

Dealing with the modern world and its crazy pace can crash your soul. **Journaling** is a simple yet effective way to keep your thoughts, emotions, and hidden convinctions under control.

Hit `Shift+Cmd+j` and write anything that is personal.

> Let yourself go.  
> Don't think.  
> Just write.
